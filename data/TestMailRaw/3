All,

One of our EMC boxes called home and indicated that two Fiberchannel cards 
are about to go bad. The recommendation by EMC is to replace the hardware. 
The affected systems are:

- Picasso: Registry production database
- Rousseau: Numerous Oracle development databases
- Ecomprod: E-Commerce production database
- Camscams: CAMS production database
- Renoir: Numerous Sybase development databases
- Oraprod1: Not used
- Pyramus: DSS Sybase production database
- Cnetdb: Cashnet Oracle production database
- Cnetapp: Cashnet production application
- Ofappdev1 and ofappdev2: Oracle Financials development application servers
- Midas1 and Midas2: OOD production transition and reporting servers
- Cfprod: Core Financials production server
- Axapp2: Axess production application server

The plan is to replace the hardware at 7pm. In order to do so, we are 
planning to shutdown development servers at 6pm and production servers at 
6:30pm. The work will take approximately 1 hour. We'll start startup of the 
servers by 8pm and applications should be back up the latest 9pm. The data 
stored on the EMC will be unaffected by this work.

Meighan and myself are calling clients to make them aware of this and 
understand potential impact. I'll send an update if the plan or timeline 
changes.

Please contact Meighan or myself via email (we are both online) if you have 
any questions. Or call me at (408) 297-0361.

Thanks,
Bernadette
